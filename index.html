  <p>An indefinite suspension of the Illinois Lottery Powerball late yesterday evening has sowed frustration and confusion among lottery players, driving some to play in Indiana. The Illinois Lottery suspended the game last night and will not permit ticket sales until the state budget crisis is resolved. </p>
  <p>One woman, Anna Ali of Chicago, ventured from downtown with her family of five to a gas station in Munster, Ind., where four of them each bought a ticket for the Powerball and Mega Millions games. The Mega Millions game could also be suspended tomorrow at 9:45 pm if no state budget is passed.</p>
  <p>“We play every time we see the numbers go high. My sister plays about every week,” Ali said. But Ali spoke of frustration with more than lottery tickets sales.</p>
  <p>“I really don’t know what’s going on with the politicians. The politicians don’t deliver, and they blame it all on Rauner,” Ali said, speaking of state government officials in Springfield. </p>
  <p>One Illinois resident, Sergio Moore, 34, was in the Marathon gas station in Lansing, IL on Torrence Avenue. Asked about the suspension, he simply asked “Why? I just wanna know why,” at first, but elaborated: </p>
  <p>“I only play the lottery in Indiana. Indiana doesn’t have any problems with paying out. I live close to the border so I’ll go there for gas.” According to Moore, Illinois was “good before we put a billionaire in office,” referring to Governor Bruce Rauner. Gov. Rauner’s tax returns reported an income of $188 million in 2015. </p>
  <p>Before Moore left, he bought a soda and laughed with the attendant, “In a couple days this will be $2.” Moore was referring to the Cook County soda tax set to take effect on July 1.</p>
  <p>The attendant he spoke to was David Adams, who witnessed some cases of Illinois residents not being able to buy Powerball tickets. </p>
  <p>“It happened today where it wasn’t able to make the sale. The machine kept cancelling the sale,” Adams said. It seemed that trying to purchase a Powerball ticket was the best way to find out that you couldn’t. </p>
  <p>“I find there is a low awareness,” Adams said, saying some were “caught off guard.” </p>
  <p>Adams said he usually doesn’t sell many lottery tickets, but that “kinda makes sense” to him. </p>
  <p>“If you pay attention, there hasn’t been a winner in Illinois for a long time. There’s no real winners coming out of Illinois. If it were me, and I don’t play, I’d see this is as a reason not to play. What’s the money for? It’s for nothing.” </p>
  <p>In response to hearing that most lottery sale money has gone toward funding the budget for certain school programs, however, Adams said “What school budget? The schools are broken.” </p>
